           There are 285 million people suffering from visual impairment worldwide with 39 million blind and 246
millions with low vision. The economic impact is estimated to have approached $3 trillion dollars
globally in 2010 with conservative estimates approaching $75 billion dollars per annum in the United
States alone. While therapeutic advances are in the 'pipeline' for a handful of conditions, there are a
multitude of causes that still engender severe visual disability. Additionally, many of these
conditions are on the rise. This is only compounded by the fact that children born premature are now
surviving at increasing rates, a wonderful trend that nevertheless increases the need for assistive
technology, as retinopathy of prematurity is increasing significantly in this population. The most
unsettling of these facts are the associated increases in mortality and morbidity, which are sadly
contributed to by increases in suicide.

           Decreases in vision and sensory loss constrain one's mobility. This inevitably leads to issues with
unemployment, quality of life losses , and functional dependencies that limit
psychosocial wellbeing. The status quo currently offered to
address the mobility needs of those with visual impairment is to
provide a white cane as an assistive device. This
assistive technology tool is simply a stick or staff that can be folded
and perhaps also fitted with a variable tip. In our current era of
self-driving vehicles and automated route mapping, there is clear need
to move beyond this severely outdated cane technology, with a
paradigm shift toward modern tools that will allow the visually
impaired to regain the mobility losses associated with sensory
deprivation, and stop the current downward 'spiral' of debility.

            Our long-term goal is to reverse the increased
morbidity and mortality resulting from low vision and
blindness by providing wearable technology solutions with
pan-applicability to visual deficits from ALL etiologies,
leading to true functional independence. Our proposed
solution, the Visually Impaired "Smart" Service System for
Spatial Intel & On-board Navigation (VIS 4 ION), provides
real-time situational and obstacle awareness in one's
immediate environment, allowing the individual to travel
more safely in three-dimensional (3D) space, paying
particular attention to low-body, mid-body and high-body/head hazards. The device remedies the cane's
shortcomings, and, in addition, further augments the ability
of visually impaired persons to both maintain balance and
to localize objects in their environment.

           The results from this research will have broad impacts in the advancement of knowledge in the research
areas of assistive technology and low vision, human-computer interactions, computer vision, and machine
learning. The research results will be disseminated through publications in international conferences and
journals. In addition to Ph.D. students, we plan to involve BS, MS, and medical students in the research
project and advise on their senior design projects and thesis. We will integrate student training, course
developments, laboratory experiments, outreach, and knowledge dissemination into our proposed efforts.
A project website will be developed along with teaching modules focusing on various parts of the project
to allow for knowledge transfer and outreach. We will target community schools through various
mechanisms including our existing STEM programs. NYU-Tandon has significant activities in STEM
efforts (including NSF sponsored projects) as well as extensive outreach programs that involve high
schools with minority and underrepresented groups.
