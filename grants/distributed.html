           This research project focuses on development of a new scalable and flexible paradigm for distributed
multi-agent dynamic environment awareness and multi-agent environment-aware motion planning. Specifically,
            the proposed research seeks to develop a set of interconnected algorithms for efficient distributed
three-dimensional dynamic environment awareness and autonomous multi-agent environment-aware realtime
            motion planning, and to validate the developed algorithmic systems through extensive simulation-based and
            experimental studies on a multi-agent networked experimental platform. The proposed project
considers a set of stationary and mobile sensor agents (that could, in general, be heterogeneous and combinations
            of manned/tele-operated/autonomous agents) that are equipped with a heterogeneous set of sensors
for perception of the environment and operating within an a priori uncertain and dynamic environment.

            The intellectual merit of the proposed research project is development of a novel unified
            framework and algorithms for efficient and robust distributed data fusion and multi-agent autonomous
intelligence for a heterogeneous set of stationary/moving sensors taking into account various sources of
            uncertainty, dynamic and uncertain environments, mobility characteristics of the moving sensor agents, and
communication constraints and limitations. The proposed approach leverages state-of-the-art techniques
from multiple research domains including sensor data fusion,
            low-dimensional representations, 3D environment modeling, dynamic motion prediction, and
            multi-agent planning to address complex uncertain
dynamic environments and stationary/mobile heterogeneous sensor agents. Although each of the
            subproblems for the multi-agent application has been considered, the totality of the problem combining all the
aforementioned issues creates a highly challenging open problem requiring novel approaches and at points
inclusion of heuristics to attain computationally attractive solutions for multi-agent systems. Additionally,
the proposed experimental testbed utilizing several of our existing platforms will show the efficacy of our
proposed approach. Lastly, while the focus of the present proposal is on fusing EO/IR cameras, LIDAR,
and robot onboard navigation sensors (e.g., inertial navigation sensors, with or without GPS), the proposed
algorithms can also apply directly or be extended to other sensory modalities.

           The proposed project aims to advance the state of knowledge in the broad area of distributed
            three-dimensional environment awareness and multi-agent autonomy. The results from this
            research will have a direct impact in several applications such as transportation (e.g., intelligent highway
vehicle system, formations, swarms, etc.), surveillance, traffic monitoring, search and rescue, law enforcement,
            security, fire fighting, and environmental monitoring to name a few. The research results will be
disseminated through publications in national and international conferences and journals. The investigators
            guide graduate and undergraduate students in summer research experience for undergraduates, theses,
dissertations, senior design projects, and honors college for students pursuing a dual bachelors and masters
            degree. There will be high emphasis on integrating student training, course development, laboratory
experiment development, outreach, and dissemination into the proposed effort. An extensive website will
be developed along with teaching modules (or virtual learning systems) focusing on multi-agent systems
and dynamic environment modeling to play a key role in knowledge transfer and outreach to schools in
the community through various mechanisms including existing STEM programs. Undergraduate students
and high-school students also participate in research projects through summer research programs as well
as senior design projects.
