           The current proposal is an outgrowth of the REF-funded project "Computationally-engaged approaches to rhythm and musical heritage: Generation, analysis, and performance practice." In the previous project we expanded our work towards a more active interaction with the musical heritage from a region constituted by what is often called the Arab mashriq (comprising the present-day countries Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Jordan and western Iraq); the countries of the Arabian Gulf and Peninsula (including eastern Iraq); South India, and the western Indian Ocean (including port cities and regions of eastern Africa); henceforth simply referred to as "the region."
        </p>
        <p align="justify" style="font-size: 18px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            In this proposal, we intend to deepen the research undertaken in the previous project for the cross-cultural comparison of the music from the region, focusing this time more deeply in the music from the UAE, and on the development of generative music applications that can reliably produce stylistically-appropriate music derived from our data-driven analysis. Specifically, we will continue developing multidimensional data analysis and visualization approaches to the digital music collections we create and/or have access to, and consolidate our methodology for the creation of generative music applications. This will be done in four interconnected streams: 1- Improvement of algorithms and machine learning techniques for the computational analysis and understanding of music from the region; 2- Development of machine learning techniques for musical data interpretation; 3- Creation of a digital corpus of Emirati music consisting of existing recordings (to be digitized if necessary), and also of original recording of existing groups currently preserving the musical traditions of the Emirates; 4- Creation of real-time generative music models.
        </p>
        <p align="justify" style="font-size: 18px">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            This project will benefit from the research infrastructure provided by the Music and Sound Cultures research group (http://masc.hosting.nyu.edu/masc_people.html), now in its third year of existence, and the support of NYUAD's Center for Digital Scholarship (CDS). The investigators and collaborators involved represent a broad spectrum of expertise, including ethnomusicology, machine learning, music composition, library science, computational modeling, and the digital humanities, as well as music improvisation and performance.

            We believe the work proposed here has the potential to advance the state of knowledge related to the collection and preservation of musical styles from the region while opening that knowledge to new analytical techniques, namely through the development of machine-learning analysis and visualization strategies of the multidimensional aspects of this data. This will certainly lead to new insights about relationships between the different styles from this rather vast region. It will underpin advances in modeling our understanding of the human experience of rhythm, and consequently of music, as well as permit novel creative processes based on such models for the generation and dissemination of interactive artworks and applications aimed at a broad public. Of particular interest are the envisioned collaborations between the group and the UAE Ministry of Culture and Knowledge Development (MCKD) for a deeper understanding of Emirati music traditions, and the possibilities for dissemination of this work throughout the Emirati population, and with the to-be-created Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR) at NYUAD aiming at the creation of inexpensive robotic devices with a musical behavior capable of interacting with humans.

This next period is another solid step on our research agenda toward developing a nascent field that we call sonic digital humanities (SDH). This is a branch of the digital humanities that is primarily concerned with the computational analysis and understanding of music and other forms of sound culture from large digital collections, and the development of methodologies for cross-cultural mapping and comparison of these materials. SDH also includes the qualitative study of the ways in which music and sound cultures, and their attendant epistemologies (including those of the sonic digital humanities themselves), have been shaped by digital technologies.
