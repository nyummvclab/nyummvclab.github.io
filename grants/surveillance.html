           Modern buildings are often equipped with many CCTV cameras. Surveillance systems are of prime impor-
tance to many environments (e.g., offices, streets and homes) for the purpose of protecting the safety of peo-
ple and properties. This project aims to develop intelligent analysis of videos that will enhance security and
surveillance solutions by automatically monitoring video of people and their associated behaviors in an in-
door environment. Specifically, we focus on the development of a seamlessly integrated indoor surveillance
system that collaborates multiple data analysis components (detection-based person tracking, abnormal be-
havior detection and face recognition) and a heterogeneous set of features that are obtained from a set of
distributed surveillance cameras. The proposed surveillance system for controlled indoor environments will
achieve full-time, omni-directional, on-line and incremental dynamic environment awareness by benefiting
from the efficiency of cloud-based high performance computations, heterogeneity on multiple levels (e.g,
sensor channels, feature types, analytical algorithms and training data sources) and advancements of deep
learning techniques. This research seeks to develop robust algorithms for multiple interconnected analyt-
ical modules, in an attempt to build an autonomous data-driven surveillance system with instant response
to abnormal behaviors and suspicious personnels, and to validate the developed system through extensive
experimental studies on highly challenged real-world benchmarks.

            The intellectual merit of the proposed research project is the development of a novel framework and algo-
rithms for building an efficient surveillance system with high precision against various sources of uncertainty
in controlled indoor environments. The proposed approach leverages most recent advancements of various
learning and analytical techniques from multiple research domains including person detection, abnormal be-
havior detection and face recognition to collaboratively integrate predictions returned by diverse analytical
modules. Although each of the sub-module has been extensively investigated as an independent research
topic, the performance of a module can be bounded by restricting features in the two-dimensional image
domain, so that exploring novel approaches in additional domains is critically required. By extensionally
including features in the three-dimensional domain (i.e., extracting features from 3D shapes), interconnected
analytical modules can benefit from the enhanced discriminativity for improved effectiveness. Additionally,
the totality of the problem that seamlessly collaborating all discrete systematic modules creates a highly
challenging open problem, which requires novel approaches and at points inclusion of heuristics to attain
computationally attractive solutions.

           The proposed surveillance system can lead to extensive influence and improvement to traditional security
management conventions of controlled environments by significantly alleviating human efforts that are re-
quired for monitoring people and their associated behaviors. This project also aims to advance the state
of knowledge in multiple research areas including person detection, abnormal behavior detection, person
re-identification and face recognition. The results of this research can be directly applied for maintaining
regional security in controlled environments, and can be extended to a wide range of applications, including
home automation, search and rescue, fire fighting and transportation. The research results will be dissemi-
nated through publications in top-tier international conferences and journals.
