            The employment rate is abysmally low for people who are visually impaired (VI). Previous studies have
reported unemployment rates that peak at 81%, leaving approximately 20% in the workforce. These
statistics are staggering, especially when compared to a current population-wide U.S. unemployment rate
of 4%. While factors such as sex, education, and access to skills are commonly reported to limit
general employment, VI individuals experience more barriers. Their employment is often restricted by
employer attitudes about perceived difficulties to hiring, including challenges related to obtaining adaptive
equipment and providing necessary accommodations. A particularly critical impediment to
employment involves difficulties with transportation when commuting to and from work. Surveys of
unemployed blind individuals indicate that many report struggling severely with independent travel and it
has been concluded that transportation issues are major barriers to employment. Solving the social
problem of unemployment for the VI calls for a convergent research approach focused on commuting
challenges.

            The objective of the proposed effort is to address these commuting challenges by creating new
connections between VI residents and their surrounding environment through innovations in science and
engineering. The project promises advancements in computer vision, machine learning, video
compression, wireless transmission, human factors, and spatial positioning, which will enable immersive
assistive technologies that augment situational awareness through wearable devices. Central to the
success of the project is an improved scientific understanding of VI behavior during urban commuting.
Focusing on wayfinding through sidewalks and intersections, trains, and bus stops, we will create
ethograms that characterize how VI individuals function and dysfunction in urban areas. Combining
engineering breakthroughs with a systematic quantification of behavior, the project will provide real-time
spatial intelligence and online navigation assistance to localize, map, orient and direct VI people in urban
areas through various transportation modes.

           A high volume of VI from the community, as anticipated to be recruited through our Lighthouse partner,
will ensure the end user 'voice' and related behavioral research (ecology/ethology) is central to platform
enhancement. The NYC-based urban setting is key as a complex environment mired with transportation
challenges. Critical to ensuring that transportation challenges are assayed and that solutions are
meritorious, our steering committee will involve leadership from both the DOT and the MTA (in addition, a
specific real-time transportation server will be opened to us and 2D subway maps will be shared). The
expertise of these transportation experts will be channeled through the lens of accessibility experts (My
Blind Sport), the Commissioner of Human Resources and Employment at the NYPD, the Program Manager
of Assistive Tech at NYU School of Medicine, and the Director of the NYU Ability Project (see Letters of
Collaboration). We anticipate that the improved wearable at scale will be applicable to millions who are VI
and generalize to urban landscapes across the domestic US, ultimately with improved features/function.
