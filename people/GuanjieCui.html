<h3 align="left">1 Description</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
	Most traditional hand pose estimations are semi-supervised learning methods that
	require a large number of manually labeled training samples. To save those expensive and
	time-consuming datasets, this paper proposes a novel method that replaces the real data
	with synthetic data by using the transformation between their latent domains. After
	finding a mapping ffrom the dataset to the low-latitude latent domain respectively for real and synthetic datasets respectively, a cycle generative adversarial network is used to
	implement the transformation between the domains. In this process, the requirement of
	a successful transformation necessitates the generator to complete the multitask learning,
	thereby generating an indistinguishable potential domain while ensuring that the domain.

<h3 align="left">2 Method</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
	In this
project, we propose a new idea to solve the problem of limited and expensive humanlabeled datasets. The most prominent contribution is that the transformation is implemented on latent domain instead of images. Besides, the training of the generator
responsible for domain transformation is multi-tasking in order to save storage space
and achieve more fast convergence. This process is also beneficial in implementing an
end-to-end training mode. This means that the training of hand pose estimation and
domain transformation is carried out simultaneously. As displayed in Figure.1, there are two generators and discriminators.One is mainly
responsible for converting synthetic data to real data, and the other one carries out the opposite
function. Ds mainly distinguishes between synthetic images and translated images from
real images; basically, it provides high scores within the true synthetic data, and vice
verse. Even though we want to carry out latent domain transformation, it should be kept
in mind during an end-to-end training that the primary purpose of a generator purpose
is still to complete the translation of one image to another. A map for the features of a certain hidden layer from the generator is extracted as an output sample of the target
latent domain, and this output is then fed into the following basic hand pose estimation
network to predict a pose based on the input depth image.

<h3 align="left">3 Results</h3>
<p style="text-align:justify; text-justify:inter-ideograph;">
	In this section, we compare the result of this research with several mainstream methods and then points out the pros and cons of the approach of this research. Figure.2 showcases
experiment results as compared to the findings achieved using several state-of-the-art
methods. It can be seen that when the fault tolerance rate is very low, our performance is still good enough, but as the fault tolerance rate rises, we can only beat one method.
I attribute this result to the synthetic image we generated. If the synthetic dataset is
very different from the original data in probability distribution, despite the depth map
has implemented domain transform, the pose is never changed, which will limit our
methodâ€™s performance. </p>
