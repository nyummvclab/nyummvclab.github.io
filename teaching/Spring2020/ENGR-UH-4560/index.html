    <h3>Large Deep Learning Project</h3>
    <p><b>Large	Deep	Learning:	Object	Recognition	and	Detection	by	Deep	Learning:</b>	In
        computer	 vision,	object	detection	is	an	important task	to	identify	the	presence,	location,	and
        type	 of	 one	 or	 more	 objects	 in	 a	 given	figure.	 	It	 is	 a	 challenging	 problem	 that	 includes	 the
        development	of	the	approaches	for	object	recognition	(e.g.	where	are	they),	object	localization
        (e.g. what	are	their	extent),	and	object	classification	(e.g.	what	are	they). Recent	deep	learning
        techniques	have	demonstrated	the	state-of-the-art	results	for	object	detection.	The	“You	Only
        Look	Once,”	 or	 YOLO was	 developed	as	 the	 pioneering	work	 for	 object	 detection	 using	 deep
        learning	techniques.		The	YOLO	achieves nearly state-of-the-art	results	with	a	single	end-to-end
        model	that	can	perform	object	detection	in	real-time. In	this	project,	the	student	will	be	required
        to	 develop	 a	 YOLO model	 for	 object	 detection	 from	 the	 implementation from	 scratch using
        PyTorch	library.

    <h3>Deep Learning Project 1</h3>
    <p><b>CNN	for	Object	Detection	and	Classification:</b>	Image	classification	is	the
        task	of	assigning	an	input	image	one	label	from	a	fixed	set	of	categories.	This	is	one	of	the	core
        problems	 in	 Computer	 Vision	 that,	 despite	 its	 simplicity,	 has	 a	 large	 variety	 of	 practical
        applications. We	would	like	you	to	establish	a	neural	network	involving	advance	DNN	modules
        (i.e. convolution	layers,	RELU,	pooling	and	 fully	connection	layers	and	etc.)	 to	distinguish	 the
        specific	category	of	an	input	image. The	implementation	of	CNN	will	be	firstly	trained	with	the
        training	dataset.	The	trained	model	will	be	evaluated	on	the	testing	dataset.

    <h3>Deep Learning Project 2</h3>
    <p>	<b>GAN-Human	face	synthesis:</b> The	Generative	Adversarial	Networks,	or
        GANs,	 were	 introduced as	 an	 architecture	 for	 training	 generative	 models,	 such	 as	 deep
        convolutional	 neural	 networks	 for	 generating	 images. The	 GANs have	 made	 huge
        breakthroughs	 and	 can	 now	 produce	 highly	 convincing	 fake	 images	 of animals,	 landscapes,
        human	faces,	etc. The	generative	adversarial	networks	(GANs)	are	deep	neural	net	architectures
        comprised	of	two	nets,	pitting	one	against	the	other	(thus	the	“adversarial”). In	this	project,	we
        will	ask	the	student	to	understand	the	principles	of	the	GANs,	learn	how	generative	algorithms
        work,	and	for	that,	contrasting	them	with	discriminative	algorithms	is	instructive,		understand
        how	discriminative	algorithms	try	to	classify	input	data;	that	is,	given	the	features	of	an	instance
        of	data,	they	predict	a	label	or	category	to	which	that	data	belongs.

    <h3>Mini Project 1</h3>
    <p><b>Regression</b>: In	statistics,	regression	is	a	approach	to	modeling	the	relationship	between	a scalar
        dependent	 variable	 y	 and	 one	 or	 more	 explanatory	 variables	 (or	 independent variables)
        denoted	X.	The case	of	one	explanatory	variable	is	called	simple	linear
        regression.	 For	 more	 than	 one	 explanatory	 variable,	 the	 process	 is	 called	 multiple	 linear
        regression. Linear	regression	models	are	often	fitted	using	the	least	squares	approach,	but	they
        may also	be fitted	in	other	ways,	such	as	by	minimizing	the	"lack	of	fit"	in	some	other	norm	(as
        with	least	absolute	 deviations	 regression),	 or	 by	minimizing	a	 penalized	 version	 of	 the	least
        square	 loss	 function	 as	 in	 ridge	 regression	 (L2-norm	 penalty)	 and	 lasso	(L1-norm	 penalty).
        Conversely,	the	least	squares	approach	can	be	used	to	fit	models	that	are	not	linear	models. Thus,
        although	 the	 terms	 "least	 squares"	 and	 "linear	 model"	 are	 closely	 linked,	 they	 are	 not
        synonymous. This	project	will	ask	the	student	to	implement	the	regression	model	to	fit	the	data.

    <h3>Mini Project 2</h3>
    <p><b>SVM	for	classification:</b>	A	Support	vector	machines	(SVMs,	also	support	vector	networks)	are
        supervised	 learning models	 with	 associated	 learning	 algorithms	 that	 analyze	 data	 used	 for
        classification	 and regression	 analysis.	 Given	 a	 set	 of	 training	 examples,	 each	 marked	 as
        belonging	to	one	or the	other	of	two	categories,	an	SVM	training	algorithm	builds	a	model	that
        assigns	new examples	to	one	category	or	the	other,	making	it	a	non-probabilistic	binary	linear
        classifier	(although	methods	such	as	Platt	scaling	exist	to	use	SVM	in	a	probabilistic classification
        setting).	An	SVM	model	is	a	representation	of	the	examples	as	points	in	space, mapped	so	that
        the	examples	of	the	separate	categories	are	divided	by	a	clear	gap	that is	as	wide	as	possible.
        New	examples	are	 then	mapped	into	 that	 same	 space	and predicted	 to	 belong	 to	a	 category
        based	on	which	side	of	the	gap	they	fall.	This	gap	is	also called	maximum	margin	and	the	SVM
        classifier	is	called	maximum	margin	classifier. This	project	will	ask	the	student	to	implement	the
        SVM	model	to	classify	the	data.

    <h3>Mini Project 3</h3>
    <p><b>K-NN:</b>	 In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method
        used for classification and regression. K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the most basic yet essential
        classification algorithms in Machine Learning. It is a supervised learning method which has intense
        applications in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection. In general, KNN is a model
        that classifies data points based on the points that are most similar to it. It uses test data to make a
        guess on what an unclassified point should be classified as. This project will ask the student to train
        KNN for the data classification.

    <h3>Mini Project 4</h3>
    <p><b>K-means	and	Hierarchical	Clustering:</b>	K-means	clustering	is	a	method	of	vector	quantization,
        originally	 from	signal	processing,	 that	is popular	 for	cluster	analysis	in	data	mining.	k-means
        clustering	aims	to	partition	n	observations into	k	clusters	in	which	each	observation	belongs	to
        the	 cluster	 with	 the	 nearest	 mean,	 serving	 as a	 prototype	 of	 the	 cluster.	 This	 results	 in	 a
        partitioning	 of	 the	 data	 space	 into	 Voronoi	 cells. Hierarchical	 clustering	 involves	 creating
        clusters	 that	 have	 a	 predetermined	 ordering	 from	 top	 to bottom.	 For	 example,	 all	 files	 and
        Page 4 of 5
        folders	 on	 the	 hard	 disk	 are	 organized	 in	 a	 hierarchy.	 There	 are two	 types	 of	 hierarchical
        clustering,	Divisive	and	Agglomerative.

    <h3>Mini Project 5</h3>
    <p><b>PCA:</b>	 In pattern recognition, high-dimensional data are very common which poses several challenges
        for classification and regression. The main purposes of a principal component analysis are the analysis
        of data to identify patterns and finding patterns to reduce the dimensions of the dataset with minimal
        loss of information. In general, Principal component analysis (PCA) is a procedure for reducing the
        dimensionality of the variable space by representing it with a few orthogonal (uncorrelated) variables
        that capture most of its variability. PCA is an unsupervised learning method which find patterns
        without reference to prior knowledge. This project deals with decision trees in data mining.

    <h3>Mini Project 6</h3>
    <p><b>Classification	with	Neural	Network:</b>	 Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) or connectionist systems
        are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal
        brains. The neural network itself is not an algorithm, but rather a framework for many different
        machine learning algorithms to work together and process complex data inputs. Such systems " learn
        " to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any taskspecific rules. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats
        by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the results
        to identify cats in other images. They do this without any prior knowledge about cats, for example,
        that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. Instead, they automatically generate identifying
        characteristics from the learning material that they process.
